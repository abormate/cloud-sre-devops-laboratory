Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among applications and services. 
By decoupling senders and receivers, it allows for secure and highly available communication between 
independently written applications. Google Cloud Pub/Sub delivers low-latency/durable messaging, and 
is commonly used by developers in implementing asynchronous workflows, distributing event notifications, 
and streaming data from various processes or devices
