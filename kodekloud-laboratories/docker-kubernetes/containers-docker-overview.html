Container + Orchestration (Docker and Kubernetes)
--------------------------------------------------
- Docker, most popular docker technology

Why you need Docker? 
--------------------------------------------------
- Consider, you have an application running on top of resources comprising an infrastructure/service parts or web of nodeJS (web server), expressJS, mongoDB (database), 
redis (messaging service), and ansible (orchestration tool - for config management).
- We've had a lot of issues developing this application with all these different components
- Their compatability with the underlying Operating System. We had to make sure these components were compatible with the current version of the OS.
- We'll need to carefully look for another OS version that's compatible for all these service parts.
- Additionally, the dependencies and libraries that's on the OS -- we need to ensure these services are compatible with those OS components.
- Every time something changed. We need to go through the compatability between these elements. Which makes things difficult.
- Another pain-point is that developers use different OS themselves for developing parts of the application. Which leads to inconsistencies of how
the application behaves differently when tested in different environments or OS (along with the libraries and dependencies).

What can containers (like Docker) do?
--------------------------------------------------
- Solves the compatability issues or the matrix from hell.
- With Docker, you can run each service component (like nodeJS, mongoDB, Redis, and Ansible) in an isolated area with its own dependencies and libraries
  within the same VM (virtual machine) or OS.
- Something that allows us to modify each service component without affecting the other components. Or even modify the underlying OS for the infra, as needed.
- We just have to build the Docker configuration once. And our developers could work and collaborate seamlessly.

What are containers? 
--------------------------------------------------
- Containers are completely isolated environments. They have their own network interfaces, own mounts, and own processes. Just like virtual machines,
 except they all share the same OS kernel. 

Containers vs Virtual Machines
--------------------------------------------------
- Containers are lightweight. And doesn't require a separate OS to be run on a server. 
- Whereas, virtual machines require the OS for each instance. Making it cumbersome. 
- Containers boots up very quickly. 
- Virtual machines are completely isolated from each other on a server. Making it possible to run different OS on a single Hypervisor. Like a MacOS, and
  beside it a Windows OS machine.
