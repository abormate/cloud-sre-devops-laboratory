The Nautilus security team performed an audit on all servers present in 
Stratos DC. During the audit some critical data/files were identified 
which were having the wrong permissions as per security standards. 

Once the report was shared with the production support team, they 
started fixing the issues one by one. It has been identified that 
one of the files named /etc/hosts on Nautilus App 1 server has wrong 
permissions, so that needs to be fixed and the correct ACLs needs to 
be set.
