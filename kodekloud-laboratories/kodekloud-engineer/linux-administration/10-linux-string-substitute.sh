The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files 
used by the Nautilus application. 

However, these template XML files must 
be populated with valid data before they can be used. 

One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp 
industries is to apply string and file manipulation commands!

-- Note --

Replace all occurances of the string Random to Echo-Location on the XML 
file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.
