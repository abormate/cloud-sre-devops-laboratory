The Nautilus team doesnt want its data to be accessed by any of 
the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data 
to be strictly accessed by the sysadmin group of the team.

Setup a collaborative directory /sysadmin/data on app server 2 in 
Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group sysadmin and the 
group should own the files inside the directory. The directory 
should be read/write/execute to the user and group owners, and 
others should not have any access.
