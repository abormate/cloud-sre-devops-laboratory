During the weekly meeting, the Nautilus DevOps team discussed about the automation and 
configuration management solutions that they want to implement. While considering several 
options, the team has decided to go with Ansible for now due to its simple setup and minimal 
pre-requisites. The team wanted to start testing using Ansible, so they have decided to use 
jump host as an Ansible controller to test different kind of tasks on rest of the servers.
