The Nautilus development team started with new project development. 
They have created different Git repositories to manage respective 
projects source code. One of the repositories /opt/cluster.git 
was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html 
file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. 

The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.
