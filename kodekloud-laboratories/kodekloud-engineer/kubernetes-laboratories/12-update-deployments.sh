There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently, 
the Nautilus application development team developed a new version 
of the application that needs to be deployed now. As per new 
updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. 

So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:

We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service 
named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this 
deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and 
service.
