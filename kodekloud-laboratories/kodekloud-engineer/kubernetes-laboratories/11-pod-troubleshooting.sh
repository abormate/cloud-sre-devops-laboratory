One of the DevOps team members was working on to deploy a 
stack on Kubernetes cluster. Somehow the pod is not coming up and 
its failing with some errors. We need to fix this as soon as 
possible. Please look into it.

>> There is a pod named webserver and the container under it is named 
as httpd-container. It is using image httpd:latest

>> There is a sidecar container as well named sidecar-container which 
is using ubuntu:latest image.
