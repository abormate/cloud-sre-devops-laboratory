We deployed a Nginx and PHP-FPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster 
last week and it had been working fine so far. 

This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which 
caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the 
issue and fix it:


The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. 
Figure out the issue and fix the same.
