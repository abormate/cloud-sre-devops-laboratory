As a recent hire as a DevOps Engineer for Cymbal Superstore a few months ago, you have learned the ins and outs of how the company operates its e-commerce website. Specifically, the DevOps team is working on a large scale CI/CD pipeline that they would like your assistance with building. This will allow the company to help developers automate tasks, collaborate more effectively with other teams, and release software more frequently and reliably. Your experience with Cloud Source Repositories, Artifact Registry, Docker, and Cloud Build is going to be a large help since Cymbal Superstore would like to use all native Google Cloud Services for their pipeline.


Before you start this project, the DevOps team would like you to demonstrate your new skills. As part of this demonstration, they have a list of tasks they would like to see you do in an allotted period of time in a sandbox environment.

# ------------------------------------- #

Your tasks will include the following:

-- Creating a GKE cluster based on a set of configurations provided.
-- Creating a Google Source Repository to host your Go application code.
-- Creating Cloud Build Triggers that deploy a production and development application.
-- Pushing updates to the app and creating new builds.
-- Rolling back the production application to a previous version.

Overall, you will be creating a simple CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Source Repositories, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Build.
