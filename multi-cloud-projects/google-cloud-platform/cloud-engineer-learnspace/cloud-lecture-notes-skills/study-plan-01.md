There's much to cover in this section of the Exam Guide. Just as there's much for an associate cloud engineer to do when deploying and implementing cloud solutions. Let's review the diagnostic questions to help you target your study time,

to focus on the areas you need to develop your skills in the most. We'll approach this review by looking at the objectives of this exam section, and the questions you answered about each objective.

We'll introduce an objective, briefly review the answers to the related questions, then talk about where you can find out more in the learning resources, or in the Google Cloud documentation.

As we go through each section objective, use the page in your workbook to mark the specific documentation, courses or modules and quests that you'll want to emphasize in your study plan.

As you can see, there are multiple objectives in this section that have many related tasks. So you will probably need to plan for more study time in this section.
