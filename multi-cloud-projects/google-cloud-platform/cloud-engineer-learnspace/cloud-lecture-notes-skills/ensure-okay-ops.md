 What areas do you need to develop your skills in order to manage the different aspects of a Google Cloud solution? This is another important area for an associate cloud engineer,

and where you'll likely spend much of your time on the job. Let's review the diagnostic questions to help you target your study time to focus on the areas where you need to develop your skills.

We'll approach this review by looking at the objectives of this exam section, and the questions you just answered about each one. We'll introduce an objective, briefly review the answers to the related questions,

then talk about where you can find out more in the learning resources and/or in Google Cloud documentation. As we go through each section objective, use the page in your workbook to mark the specific documentation,

courses and modules, and quests you'll want to emphasize in your study plan. Just like with the previous section, there are multiple objectives in this section that have many related tasks.
