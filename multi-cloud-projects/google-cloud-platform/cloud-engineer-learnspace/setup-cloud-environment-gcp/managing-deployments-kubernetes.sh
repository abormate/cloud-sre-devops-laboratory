# Introduction to deployments
: '
Heterogeneous deployments typically involve connecting two or more distinct infrastructure environments or 
regions to address a specific technical or operational need. Heterogeneous deployments are called "hybrid", 
"multi-cloud", or "public-private", depending upon the specifics of the deployment.
'

For the purposes of this lab, heterogeneous deployments include those that span regions within a single 
cloud environment, multiple public cloud environments (multi-cloud), or a combination of on-premises and public 
cloud environments (hybrid or public-private).

Various business and technical challenges can arise in deployments that are limited to a single environment or region:
'

: '
-- Maxed out resources: In any single environment, particularly in on-premises environments, you might not have the 
compute, networking, and storage resources to meet your production needs.

-- Limited geographic reach: Deployments in a single environment require people who are geographically distant from 
one another to access one deployment. Their traffic might travel around the world to a central location.

-- Limited availability: Web-scale traffic patterns challenge applications to remain fault-tolerant and resilient.

-- Vendor lock-in: Vendor-level platform and infrastructure abstractions can prevent you from porting applications.
