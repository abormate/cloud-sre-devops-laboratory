The development team for the supply chain project is ready to start building their new cloud app using a small Kubernetes cluster for the pilot. The cluster should only be available to team members and does not need to be highly available. The developers also need the ability to change the cluster architecture as they deploy new capabilities. How would you implement this?

Initial:
Implement a private standard regional cluster in us-central1 with a default pool and container-optimized image type.
