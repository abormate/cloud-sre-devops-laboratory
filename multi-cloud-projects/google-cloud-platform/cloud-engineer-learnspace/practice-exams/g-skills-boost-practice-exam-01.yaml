# 1. 
# A supply chain application frequently analyzes large amounts of data to inform business processes and
# operational dashboards. What storage class would make sense for this use case?

# Initial: Standard

# 2.
# Client needs to populate visual dashboards with historical time-based data. This is an analytical use-case.
# Which 2 storage solutions could they work with?
# Refer to: https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/overview#other-storage-option

# Initial: Cloud BigTable
# Initial[1]: Google BigQuery

# 3.
# Which GCP load balancing option runs at the Layer 7 of the TCP stack?
# Initial: Global TCP Proxy

# 4. 
# Client decides to migrate their supply chain application to GCP. You need to configure specific OS dependencies. 
# What should you do?
# Initial: Implement app using VMs on Compute Engine

# 5.
# Amount of storage required for client to enable users to post photos for product reviews is 10TB of immediate
# access storage in the US. And 30TB of storage for historical posts in a bucket located near the client
# headquarters. The contents of this bucket will be access once every 30 days. You want to estimate the 
# cost of these storage resources to ensure this is economically feasible. What should you do?

# Initial:
# Use the pricing calculator to estimate the price for 10 TB of multi-region Standard storage, 30 TB 
# for regional Nearline, and egress charges for reads from the bucket.

# 6.
# An application running on a high-customzed version of Ubuntu needs to be migrated to GCP. 
# You need to do this in the least amount of time with minimal code changes. 
# How should you proceed?

# Initial:
# Create Compute Engine virtual machines and then migrate the app to that infra
