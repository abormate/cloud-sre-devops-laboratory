Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) have a broad set of responsibilities, and managing incidents is a critical part of their role. 
You will learn how to take advantage of the integrated capabilities of Google Cloud's operations suite that includes logging, 
monitoring, and rich, out-of-the-box dashboards.

The troubleshooting process is an “iterative” approach where SREs form a hypothesis about the potential root cause of an incident, 
then filter, search, and navigate through large volumes of telemetry data collected from their systems to validate or invalidate their hypothesis. 
If a hypothesis is invalid, SREs will form another hypothesis and perform another iteration until they can isolate a root cause.
