# Task 6 - Review code build pipeline
#
# ---------------------------- #

#
# Most of the procedure steps here could be done via the visual Console
# Not much code required for this particular task
#

#
# Step 1 -- In the console, go to: Cloud Build > Dashboard
#

#
# Step 2 -- Examine the logs of "hello-cloudbuild-app" trigger and follow its execution. 
# The last step of this pipeline pushes the new manifest to the "hello-cloudbuild-env" repo,
# which triggers the continuous delivery pipeline.
