--scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/source.read_write,cloud-platform"

# verify cluster is running
gcloud container cluster list

# get credentials for your cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd

Kubernetes Engine uses these credentials to access your newly provisioned clusterâ€”confirm that you can connect to it by running the following command:
kubectl cluster-info
