Dev Ops practices will regularly make use of multiple deployments to manage application deployment scenarios 
such as "Continuous deployment", "Blue-Green deployments", "Canary deployments" and more. 
This is to provide practice in scaling and managing containers so you can accomplish these common scenarios where multiple heterogeneous 
deployments are being used.

Heterogeneous deployments typically involve connecting two or more distinct infrastructure environments or regions to address 
a specific technical or operational need. Heterogeneous deployments are called "hybrid", "multi-cloud", or "public-private", 
depending upon the specifics of the deployment.

For the purposes of this lab, heterogeneous deployments include those that span regions within a single cloud environment, 
multiple public cloud environments (multi-cloud), or a combination of on-premises and public cloud environments (hybrid or public-private).
